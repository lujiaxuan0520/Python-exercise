The furthest distance in the world Is not between life and death
But when I stand in front of you Yet you don¡¯t know that I love you
The furthest distance in the world  Is not when I stand in front of you
Yet you can¡¯t see my love But when undoubtedly knowing the love from both
Yet cannot be together The furthest distance in the world
Is not being apart while being in love But when plainly cannot resist the yearning
Yet pretending you have never been in my heart The furthest distance in the world
Is not but using one¡¯s indifferent heart To dig an uncrossible river
For the one who loves you
